### Hi there :wave:

I'm JT. I'm not a professional developer; I'm more of a hobbyist in all things Linux and System Administration. By trade I work in entertainment and travel/tourism having served in most of the behind the scenes technology positions for [Premier Cruise Line][pcl], [Disney Cruise Line][dcl], and [Holland America Line][hal]. Most recently I've been working for [Lucid Creative][lucid] as Operations Manager handling our interactions with a few major clients and handling our system administration needs for our development branch.
