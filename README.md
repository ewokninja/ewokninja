Hi, I'm JT. I'm not a professional developer; I'm more of a hobbyist in all things Linux and System Administration. By trade I work in entertainment and travel/tourism having served in most of the behind the scenes technology positions for [Premier Cruise Line][pcl], [Disney Cruise Line][dcl], and [Holland America Line][hal]. Most recently I've been working for [Lucid Creative][lucid] as Operations Manager handling our interactions with a few major clients and handling our system administration needs for our development branch.

* :evergreen_tree: working on personal wellbeing
* :books: learning [ansible][ansible] and [houdini][houdini]
* :crown: dungeons and dragons enthusiast
* :tv: interested in revamping twitch overlays/motion graphics
* :speech_balloon: let's chat about technology in live events
* :mailbox: get a hold of me `jt at jonathan dash tom dot com`
* :bowtie: pronouns he/him
* :mortar_board: fun fact: I've been to every continent save antarctica
